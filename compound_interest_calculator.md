## What is ci_calc

The "compound interest calculator" (or "ci_calc") generates a nice overview of compound interest possibilities for your specific investment plan. This overview is saved in an .xlsx Excel file with 3 sheets:  
* The first sheet is an overview of different investment periods.
* The second sheet gives all possible outcomes for each month + average yearly return comibination
* The third sheet shows the month-over-month equivalent of year-on-year returns from 0 - 100%

## Why ci_calc

ci_calc aims to help with multiple things:

1. Help pick an investment plan that fits specific budgets, plans & desires.
2. Get a feel for how your investment plan can/will turn out
3. Estimate the average year-on-year return of a certain dollar-cost-averaging history
4. Assure anyone that slow but steady wins the race

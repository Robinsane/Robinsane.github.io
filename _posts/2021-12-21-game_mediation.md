After hearing parents worry about their children's gaming behaviour for quite some time, I decided to test the market for "game mediation". During game mediation, I attempt to make both parties come to a mutual understanding. This seemed like a good fit for my profile: a calm and experienced programming teacher, who also likes to occasionally game himself.

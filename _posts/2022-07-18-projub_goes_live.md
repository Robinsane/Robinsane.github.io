Projub stands for "project hub".  
The aim of this website is to become the central sharing hub for free projects and solutions. 

fun facts:
* Hosting this website costs me nothing
* I pay 14 euros per year to remain the owner of the "projub.com" domain
* At some point in the past, this website was used to offer a free "game mediation" service
